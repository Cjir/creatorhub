                    Harry's hand without looking at him. Then Wormtail resumed his place in the circle of watching
                    Death Eaters. "You have been taught how to duel. Harry Potter?" said Voldemort softly, his red
                    eyes glinting through the darkness. At these words Harry remembered, as though from a former
                    life, the dueling club at Hogwarts he had attended briefly two years ago. ...

                  <p>
                    Voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry. He raised his wand. "Crucio!" It was
                    pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was
                    surely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end
                    ... to black out... to die ... And then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding
                    him to the headstone of Voldemort's father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind
                    of mist. The night was ringing with the sound of the Death Eaters' laughter. "You see, I think,
                    how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me," said
                    Voldemort. "But I want there to be no mistake in anybody's mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a
                    lucky chance. And I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you
                    all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will give him his
                    chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the
                    stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini," he whispered, and the snake glided away through the
                    grass to where the Death Eaters stood watching. </p>
                  </br>
                  <p>
                    "Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his
                    wand." Wormtail approached Harry, who scrambled to find his feet, to support his own weight
                    before the ropes were untied. Wormtail raised his new silver hand, pulled out the wad of
                    material gagging Harry, and then, with one swipe, cut through the bonds tying Harry to the
                    gravestone. There was a split second, perhaps, when Harry might have considered running for it,
                    but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave, as the Death Eaters
                    closed ranks, forming a tighter circle around him and Voldemort, so that the gaps where the
                    missing Death Eaters should have stood were filled. Wormtail walked out of the circle to the
                    place where Cedric's body lay and returned with Harry's wand, which he thrust roughly into
                  </p>

                    life, the dueling club at Hogwarts he had attended briefly two years ago. ... All he had learned
                    there was the Disarming Spell, "Expelliarmus". . . and what use would it be to deprive Voldemort
                    of his wand, even if he could, when he was surrounded by Death Eaters, outnumbered by at least
                    thirty to one? He had never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this. He knew he
                    was facing the thing against which Moody had always warned . . . the unblockable Avada Kedavra
                    curse - and Voldemort was right - his mother was not here to die for him this time. ... He was
                    quite unprotected. . . . "We bow to each other. Harry," said Voldemort, bending a little, but
                    keeping his snakelike face upturned to Harry. "Come, the niceties must be observed. . . .
                    Dumbledore would like you to show manners. . . . Bow to death, Harry. ..." The Death Eaters were
                    laughing again. Voldemorts lipless mouth was smiling. Harry did not bow. He was not going to let
                    Voldemort play with him before killing him ... he was not going to give him that satisfaction. .
                    . .
